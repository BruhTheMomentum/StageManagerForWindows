# [WIP] Stage Manager for Windows

This is an experimental approach to bring the macOS [Stage Manager](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213315) to Microsoft Windows with context menu in the menubar.

> **Important:** Currently WIP, being polished as you read this.

This prototype groups applications by their process. By switching between so called "scenes" on the left, Stage Manager hides other windows and the desktop icons, helping you to focus.

Windows can be moved from one scene to another by dragging them onto scenes on the left.

## Usage

Download and run the executable from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/awaescher/StageManager/releases/) or 
 - clone this repository
 - cd into the repository directory
 - run `dotnet run --project StageManager`
 
### Requirements
 - Windows 10 version 1607 (Anniversary Update, build 14393) or newer
 - [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Stage Manager is using a few code files to handle window tracking from [workspacer](https://github.com/workspacer/workspacer), an amazing open source project by [Rick Button](https://github.com/rickbutton).
